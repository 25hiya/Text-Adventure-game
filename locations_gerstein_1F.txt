You are in front of the t-card station. There is the security office next to you. You look for the t-card in your bag, in your jacket's pockets but you can't seem to find it anywhere. Tensed and worried, you go to the security officer asking you to let in. He simply stared at you as if he had enough and rudely asks for your UTORid.
